--- Description ---

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:
    a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.
"""

# Probably better to do 111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree first because I think that if max_depth - min_depth > 1,
# the tree is not height-balanced
