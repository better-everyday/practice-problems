<!-- Description -->
<div class="elfjS" data-track-load="description_content"><p>Given an <code>m x n</code> 2D binary grid <code>grid</code> which represents a map of <code>'1'</code>s (land) and <code>'0'</code>s (water), return <em>the number of islands</em>.</p>

<p>An <strong>island</strong> is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.</p>

<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre style="position: relative;"><strong>Input:</strong> grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
